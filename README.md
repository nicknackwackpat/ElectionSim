## Title

TossUp!

## Motivation

We decided to create a Tossup random Generator that implements the map of the United States. We have given the user the ability to choose up to 4 canidates and run them through our generator. Each state will have a winner and after all of the states votes are tallied we will have a full country winner!!

## Technologies

We have created a full stack app that implements the technologies of Passport, ReactJS, Node, Express, Mongooose ORM, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ajax, Github and deployed the app on Heroku.

## Usage

We have implemented a user verification via passport.The app verifys the user by name and email adress. After the user is verified, the user will pick up to 4 canidates to run throught the generator. The generator will run the 4 canidates thru each of the 50 states. Each states population are found from \***\*\_\_\_\_\*\*** . The generator gives everyone a vote and breaks down those votes to the 4 canidates. Then they are run through all 50 states and a winner is tallied and proclaimed victorious!

## Created By

Nick Phillips, Amy Hollinger, Nelson Ezeume, Joseph Vander Neut

## Future Development

We would like to color code each of the candidates and as they win a state change the color of that state to the candidates assigned color.
